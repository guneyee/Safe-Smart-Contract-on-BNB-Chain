# Safe Smart Contract on BNB Chain

**Introduction**:

In this project, we have built a secure vault smart contract on the BNB Chain. This contract acts as a secure vault for users to lock their tokens for a specified period, earning rewards over time. Each user has a separate compartment within the contract, ensuring individualized security and reward calculation.

**Features**:

- **Token Locking**: Users can send tokens to the contract and lock them for a defined period.
- **Reward Calculation**: The contract calculates rewards based on the time the tokens are locked.
- **Individual Compartments**: Each user has a unique compartment within the contract, ensuring personalized security and reward management.

**Requirements**:

- **Token Locking Mechanism**: Implemented a function to allow users to send tokens to the contract and lock them for a specified duration.
- **Reward Calculation**: Developed a mechanism to calculate rewards based on the locking period. Note that the contract will only calculate rewards; it will not distribute them.
- **User Compartments**: Created individual compartments for each user within the contract to manage their tokens and rewards separately.
- **Security Measures**: Implemented necessary security checks to ensure that only the owner of the tokens can lock, unlock, or query their compartment.
- **Testing**: Included comprehensive test cases to validate the correctness and security of the code.

**Usage**:

- Provide instructions on how to deploy and interact with the smart contract.

**Testing**:

- Explain how to run the provided test cases to validate the contract's functionality.

**Contributing**:

- Explain how others can contribute to your project if applicable.

**License**:

- Specify the license under which your code is released.

**Telegram Username**:

- Your Telegram username for communication.

**GitHub Repository**:

- Provide a link to your GitHub repository.
